# WhatsApp Bot Project

## Overview

This project is focused on developing a WhatsApp bot with the main functionalities involving predefined commands. Initially, the bot will maintain a connection with GPT-3.5 and manage the Google Calendar, as well as create a task list.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: Web framework for building the backend of the application.
- OpenAI: Used to integrate with GPT-3.5 for natural language processing.
- Ngrok: Tool used for creating secure tunnels to local servers, enabling webhook integration with WhatsApp.
- Google Calendar API: API used for managing events and schedules on Google Calendar.

## Features

- **Predefined Commands**: Users can interact with the bot using predefined commands to perform various tasks.
- **Integration with GPT-3.5**: The bot maintains a connection with GPT-3.5 to provide intelligent responses to user queries.
- **Google Calendar Management**: Users can add, update, and delete events on their Google Calendar directly through the bot.
